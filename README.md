# Current Projects

## [CHPEditor](https://github.com/DragonRatTiger/CHPEditor)

Desktop software for previewing & editing CHP files, used in select games for character animations.

The project aims to not only revitalize a nearly forgotten file format, but document every detail of it in order to expand its use beyond the limited number of applications that support it.
