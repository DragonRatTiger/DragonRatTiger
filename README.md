# Current Projects

## [CHPEditor](https://github.com/DragonRatTiger/CHPEditor)

Desktop software for previewing & editing CHP files, used in select games for character animations.

The project aims to not only revitalize a nearly forgotten file format, but document every detail of it in order to expand its use beyond the limited number of applications that support it.

## [OpenTaiko](https://github.com/0auBSQ/OpenTaiko) (led by [0auBSQ](https://github.com/0auBSQ)) [[GitHub Organization](https://github.com/OpenTaiko)]

A non-profit open-source rhythm game, with additional repositories dedicated to managing the massive amounts of content provided for users to engage with.

My work revolves primarily in improving software performance & features, providing additional graphics wherever needed, and program documentation.
